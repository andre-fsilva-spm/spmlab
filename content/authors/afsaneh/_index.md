Afsaneh L. Sanati received her PhD in Nanochemistry from University of Tehran, Iran in 2019. She worked one year (2018-2019) as a visitor researcher at University of Coimbra, Portugal and currently she has been working as a researcher at the Institute of System and Robotic (ISR), Coimbra, Portugal. Electrochemical Society of Iran selected her as a best PhD student in Electrochemistry (2018). Her current research interests include synthesis of novel nanoparticles and nano-composite and application of them in flexible/stretchable energy storage devices, Ag/Zn batteries, supercapacitors and also investigation on electrochemical behavior of electro active materials, modified electrodes in order to fabrication different type of sensors for biological, pharmaceutical and environmental compounds analysis.
