I am a dual-degree PhD candidate in Electrical Engineering from the University of Coimbra, Portugal, and Carnegie Mellon University, USA. Previously I have earned a M.Sc. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Coimbra in 2019 with a specialization in automation. 

After building my first robot at 13, I participated in dozens of tech and robotics competitions that motivated me to follow an engineering career.

One of my interests is STEM education, having developed and delivered multiple courses and workshops in robotics, electronics, programming and digital fabrication, with more than 100 participants. I am also a Teaching assistant in both CMU and UC and have advised 10 M.Sc. theses and more 15+ undergrad projects to date.

I’ve co-authored over 14 papers in leading journals (Advanced Materials, Advanced Functional Materials, Nature Electronics, etc) and given 15+ international talks on soft and stretchable electronics since 2019.

As an engineer and scientist, I am driven by the potential to create technologies that truly improve the lives of vulnerable people. I came up with life-changing tech that includes a wearable textile headband for continuous EEG recordings that was awarded by Fraunhofer and IBM, a patent-pending family of digitally printed patient-specific e-skins for electrophysiology for remote health monitoring up to 10 days with better signal quality than current clinical systems, a fully recyclable eco-friendly conductive ink that enables the fabrication of non-polluting electronic smart labels for monitoring of perishable goods, and a wearable for automatic detection and mitigation of gait freezing in Parkinson’s patients.

All these systems, currently undergoing further testing and validation, offer better user comfort, and potentially reduce operational costs and alleviate the burden in the healthcare systems promoting faster recoveries and reducing hospitalization times.

My work has been highlighted in 80+ press features in Portuguese-speaking countries and the US, and in 2023 I received a Huawei merit grant (<1% acceptance) for outstanding scientific and academic achievements.
