abstract: A preliminary study aimed at detecting the placement of a robotic hand working
  on a surface for layout and assembly purposes is presented. The goal is pursued
  by using a radiofrequency (RF) probe on the robotic hand and printed resonators
  on the surface. To detect the location of the hand orientation on the surface, the
  real part of the probe input impedance is examined for different orientations for
  each resonator placed on the surface. A special design of a coplanar dipole antenna
  with ground plane as a probe on the hand and a bended metal strip (bended dipole
  resonator) with different sizes placed on the sheet is employed. The sensing is
  performed within a near-range distance from the surface in one direction. It is
  observed that the proposed probe-resonator configuration allows the identification
  of the relative location of the hand with respect to the one of the resonators on
  the work surface with an encouraging level of accuracy.
