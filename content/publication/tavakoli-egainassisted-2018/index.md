abstract: Abstract Coating inkjet‐printed traces of silver nanoparticle (AgNP) ink
  with a thin layer of eutectic gallium indium (EGaIn) increases the electrical conductivity
  by six‐orders of magnitude and significantly improves tolerance to tensile strain.
  This enhancement is achieved through a room‐temperature “sintering” process in which
  the liquid‐phase EGaIn alloy binds the AgNP particles (≈100 nm diameter) to form
  a continuous conductive trace. Ultrathin and hydrographically transferrable electronics
  are produced by printing traces with a composition of AgNP‐Ga‐In on a 5 µm‐thick
  temporary tattoo paper. The printed circuit is flexible enough to remain functional
  when deformed and can support strains above 80% with modest electromechanical coupling
  (gauge factor ≈1). These mechanically robust thin‐film circuits are well suited
  for transfer to highly curved and nondevelopable 3D surfaces as well as skin and
  other soft deformable substrates. In contrast to other stretchable tattoo‐like electronics,
  the low‐cost processing steps introduced here eliminate the need for cleanroom fabrication
  and instead requires only a commercial desktop printer. Most significantly, it enables
  functionalities like “electronic tattoos” and 3D hydrographic transfer that have
  not been previously reported with EGaIn or EGaIn‐based biphasic electronics.
