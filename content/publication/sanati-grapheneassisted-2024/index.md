abstract: Abstract  Energy storage devices with liquid‐metal electrodes have attracted
  interest in recent years due to their potential for mechanical resilience, self‐healing,
  dendrite‐free operation, and fast reaction kinetics. Gallium alloys like Eutectic
  Gallium Indium (EGaIn) are appealing due to their low melting point and high theoretical
  specific capacity. However, EGaIn electrodes are unstable in highly alkaline electrolytes
  due to Gallium oxide dissolution. In this letter, this bottleneck is addressed by
  introducing chemically stable films in which nanoscale droplets of EGaIn are coated
  with trace amounts of graphene oxide (GO). It is demonstrated that a GO to EGaIn
  weight ratio as low as 0.01 provides enough protection for a thin film formed by
  GO@EGaIn nanocomposite against significantly acidic or alkaline environments (pH
  1‐14). It is shown that GO coating significantly enhances the surface stability
  in such environments, thus improving the energy storage capacity by over 10x. Microstructural
  analysis confirms GO@EGaIn composite stability and enhanced electrochemical performance.
  Utilizing this, a thin‐film supercapacitor is fabricated. Results indicate that
  when coating the EGaIn with GO to EGaIn ratio of 0.001, the areal capacitance improves
  by 10 times, reaching 20.02 mF cm −2 . This breakthrough paves the way for advanced
  liquid metal‐based thin‐film electrodes, promising significant improvements in energy
  storage applications.
