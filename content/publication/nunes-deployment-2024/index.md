abstract: Conventional patient monitoring in healthcare has limitations such as delayed
  identification of deteriorating conditions, disruptions to patient routines, and
  discomfort due to extensive wiring for bed-bound patients. To address these, we
  have recently developed an innovative IoT-based healthcare system for real-time
  wireless patient monitoring. This system includes a flexible epidermal patch that
  collects vital signs using low power electronics and transmits the data to IoT nodes
  in hospital beds. The nodes connect to a smart gateway that aggregates the information
  and interfaces with the hospital information system (HIS), facilitating the exchange
  of electronic health records (EHR) and enhancing access to patient vital signs for
  healthcare professionals. Our study validates the proposed smart bed architecture
  in a clinical setting, assessing its ability to meet healthcare personnel needs,
  patient comfort, and data transmission reliability. Technical performance assessment
  involves analyzing key performance indicators for communication across various interfaces,
  including the wearable device and the smart box, and the link between the gateway
  and the HIS. Also, a comparative analysis is conducted on data from our architecture
  and traditional hospital equipment. Usability evaluation involves questionnaires
  completed by patients and healthcare professionals. Results demonstrate the robustness
  of the architecture proposed, exhibiting reliable and efficient information flow,
  while offering significant improvements in patient monitoring over conventional
  wired methods, including unrestricted mobility and improved comfort to enhance healthcare
  delivery.
