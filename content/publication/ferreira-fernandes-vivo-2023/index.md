  recordings in freely behaving animals are crucial to understand the neuronal circuit
  basis of behavior. Although current multi-channel silicon probes provide unparalleled
  sampling density, the study of interacting neuronal populations requires the implantation
  of multiple probes across different regions of the brain. Ideally, these probes
  should be independently adjustable, to maximize the yield, and recoverable, to mitigate
  costs. In this work, we describe the implementation of a miniaturized 3D-printed
  headgear system for chronic textlessitalictextgreaterin vivotextless/italictextgreater
  recordings in mice using independently movable silicon probes targeting multiple
  brain regions. We successfully demonstrated the performance of the headgear by simultaneously
  recording the neuronal activity in the prelimbic cortex and dorsal hippocampus.
  The system proved to be sturdy, ensuring high-quality stable recordings and permitted
  reuse of the silicon probes, with no observable interference in mouse innate behaviors.textless/ptextgreater
