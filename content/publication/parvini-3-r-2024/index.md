abstract: Abstract  Billions of disposable thin‐film electronics will be produced
  annually in the near future, for applications in smart packaging, IoT, and wearable
  biomonitoring patches. For these cases, traditional rigid batteries are not optimal
  neither in terms of form and ergonomics nor ecological aspects. There is an urgent
  need for a new class of energy storage devices that are thin, stretchable, resilient,
  and recyclable. Herein, a novel architecture of materials and fabrication techniques
  is presented that permit a fully 3D printed soft‐matter thin‐film battery that is
  Resilient to mechanical strain, Repairable if cut, Rechargeable, and Recyclable
  at the end of its life. By taking advantage of a digitally printable ultra‐stretchable
  liquid metal‐based current collector and a novel Gallium‐Carbon anode electrode,
  the Ag 2 O‐Gallium battery is rapidly printed and customized per application. By
  optimizing the properties of the Gallium‐Carbon composite, a record‐breaking areal
  capacity of 26.37 mAh cm −2 is obtained, which improves after 10 cycles at 100%
  strain to 30.32 mAh cm −2 , and an unprecedented maximum strain tolerance of ≈200%.
  Partially damaged batteries heal themselves. Severely damaged batteries are healed
  through innovative cold‐vapor stimulation. An example of a digitally printed, taylor‐made
  battery‐on‐the‐board health‐monitoring patch with printed sensors for monitoring
  the heart, and respiration is demonstrated.
