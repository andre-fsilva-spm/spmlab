abstract: Abstract The increasing interest in epidermal patches for wearable monitoring
  makes it urgent to move toward “greener” and recyclable materials in printed electronics.
  However, combining scalable fabrication, stretchable function, and recyclable material
  architecture is challenging to achieve. Herein, this article introduces a printable
  biphasic liquid metal (LM)‐based composite that combines excellent electrical conductivity,
  high stretchability, low‐electromechanical gauge factor, printability, sinter‐free
  functionality, and compatibility with heat‐sensitive substrates, thanks to the sinter‐free
  formulation. The novel eutectic gallium indium LM‐nickel‐styrene‐isoprene (SIS)
  thermoplastic elastomer composite takes advantage of a “greener” solvent composed
  of a mixture of methyl acetate, cyclohexane, and 4‐chlorobenzotrifluoride compared
  to the toluene used in block copolymers (BCPs). Furthermore, it replaces the costly
  micron‐sized silver flake filler particles with nickel, a lower‐cost alternative
  that enables facile recyclability by using a magnetic force. The use of BCPs with
  non‐permanent physical cross‐links enables the possibility of recycling. A green
  route is shown for recycling the composite, using only bio‐friendly acids and daily
  used products such as sugar and Epsom salt. The application of these composites
  is shown through the digital printing of stretchable circuits and magnetic switches.
