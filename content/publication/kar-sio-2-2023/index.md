abstract: Flexible electronic skins (e‐skins) have a wide range of applications in
  health monitoring, human–machine interfaces, and robotics. Herein, a novel architecture
  of e‐skins with a combination of multimode measurement and low‐cost implementation
  is proposed. A single electronic skin layer is used to integrate both the pressure
  and temperature sensing properties. An e‐skin membrane is first developed with poly(vinylidene)
  fluoride incorporated with silicon dioxide nanoparticles. When combined with electrodes,
  this simple architecture allows the implementation of multimode pressure and temperature
  sensing. This e‐skin exhibits excellent pressure sensitivity with a response time
  of 1.6 ms. This sensing performance can be attributed to the uniform distribution
  of the embedded nanoparticles, leading to an enhancement of the electroactive β
  phase. This e‐skin generates a voltage, from the finger movements, that can be used
  to detect precisely the minute changes of the finger movement. This electronic skin
  demonstrates the detection of a linear range of temperature which can be attributed
  to the phonon‐assisted hopping mechanism. A 4 × 4 pressure sensing array is demonstrated,
  which is able to map the inserted pressure as well as temperature stimuli. Thus,
  this study provides a new conceptual design for the next‐generation green electronic
  skins.
