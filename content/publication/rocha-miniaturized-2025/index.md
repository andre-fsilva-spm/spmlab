abstract: Abstract  Over the past years, rapid progress has been made on soft‐matter
  electronics for wearable and implantable devices, for bioelectronics and optogenetics.
  Liquid Metal (LM) based electronics are especially popular, due to their long‐term
  durability, when subject to repetitive strain cycles. However, one major limitation
  has been the need for tethering bioelectronics circuits to external power, or the
  use of rigid bulky batteries. This has motivated a growing interest in wireless
  energy transfer, which demands circuit miniaturization. However, miniaturization
  of LM circuits is challenging due to low LM‐substrate adhesion, LM smearing, and
  challenges on microchip‐interfacing. In this article, these challenges are addressed
  by high‐resolution laser‐assisted micropatterning of biphasic LM composites and
  vapor‐assisted LM microchip soldering. Through the development of a search algorithm
  for optimization of the biphasic ink coil performance, micro coils with trace spacing
  of 50 µm are designed and implemented that can harvest a significant amount of energy
  (178 mW cm −2 ) through near field inductive coupling. Miniaturized soft‐matter
  circuits with integrated SMD chips such as NFC chips, capacitors, and LEDs that
  are implemented in a few minutes through laser patterning, and vapor‐assisted soldering.
  In the context of optogenetics, where lightweight, miniaturized systems are needed
  to provide optical stimulation, soft coils stand out in terms of their improved
  conformability and flexibility. Thus, this article explores the applications of
  soft coils in wearable and implantable devices, with a specific focus on their use
  in optogenetics.
