abstract: 'Abstract  Despite the rapid progress on soft and stretchable batteries,
  current fabrication techniques involve manual disposition and stencil/screen printing.
  Here, for the first time, a 3D‐printed Ag–Ga battery is introduced through subsequent
  printing of four sinter‐free composites: a stretchable Liquid Metal (LM) EGaIn‐Ag‐Styrene‐isoprene
  block copolymers (SIS), and Carbon‐SIS current collectors; Ag 2 O‐SIS cathode; and
  a novel Ga‐C‐SIS anode. Being sinter‐free results in faster printing, and compatibility
  with heat‐sensitive substrates. Although the Ga‐C‐SIS is solid‐like and nonsmearing
  after printing, it creates a liquid interface after contacting with the electrolyte.
  This results in a self‐feeding and self‐aggregation mechanism that brings more gallium
  to the surface and delays the formation of the dead surface. The record‐breaking
  areal capacity of ≈19.4 mAh cm −2 , along with excellent stretchability (textgreater130%
  Max. strain), makes the Ag–Ga battery an excellent alternative to Ag–Zn batteries.
  Surprisingly, digital printing results in 3x higher areal capacity compared to stencil
  printing, due to greater gallium exposure at the surface. The desired voltage and
  current output can be customized by printing several battery cells and interconnect
  them in series/parallel. Also, printing of sensors, electrodes, batteries, and interconnects
  on a biomonitoring e‐textile for simultaneous monitoring of electrocardiography,
  body temperature, and respiration is demonstrated.'
