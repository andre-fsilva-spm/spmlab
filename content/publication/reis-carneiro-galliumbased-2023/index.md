abstract: Abstract Soft and stretchable electronics have diverse applications in the
  fields of compliant bioelectronics, textile‐integrated wearables, novel forms of
  mechanical sensors, electronics skins, and soft robotics. In recent years, multiple
  material architectures have been proposed for highly deformable circuits that can
  undergo large tensile strains without losing electronic functionality. Among them,
  gallium‐based liquid metals benefit from fluidic deformability, high electrical
  conductivity, and self‐healing property. However, their deposition and patterning
  is challenging. Biphasic material architectures are recently proposed as a method
  to address this problem, by combining advantages of solid‐phase materials and composites,
  with liquid deformability and self‐healing of liquid phase conductors, thus moving
  toward scalable fabrication of reliable stretchable circuits. This article reviews
  recent biphasic conductor architectures that combine gallium‐based liquid‐phase
  conductors, with solid‐phase particles and polymers, and their application in fabrication
  of soft electronic systems. In particular, various material combinations for the
  solid and liquid phases in the biphasic conductor, as well as methods used to print
  and pattern biphasic conductive compounds, are discussed. Finally, some applications
  that benefit from biphasic architectures are reviewed.
