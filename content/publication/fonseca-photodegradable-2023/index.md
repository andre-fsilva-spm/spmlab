abstract: Abstract  The increasing interest in disposable electronics such as wearable
  patches, e‐textiles, and smart packaging, warns emergence of another man‐made disaster.
  A paradigm shift toward a more sustainable future through the development of soft
  material architectures that are robust and durable, but also degradable by external
  stimuli is proposed. Hydrogels, a class of soft polymers with exceptional properties,
  and high water content are rarely used as substrates, mainly due to lack of ink‐adhesion
  and rapid dehydration. Herein, photodegradable hydrogels are tailor‐made that are
  nondrying, robust, adhesive to ink, and permit triggerable degradation, making them
  suitable substrates for sustainable electronics. These hydrogels are prepared by
  reversible ionic crosslinking between sodium alginate and divalent cations (Ca 2+
  ) and light‐responsive crosslinking of poly(acrylamide) (PAAm) chains through synthesized
  ortho‐nitrobenzyl (ONB)‐based crosslinkers. By displacing the water molecules in
  the hydrogels by immersion in glycerol, the drying problem and printability of conductive
  ink are addressed. It is demonstrated that digital printing of a liquid metal (LM)‐based
  stretchable ink over the developed substrate, shows several body‐worn printed wearable
  sensors, and demonstrates their degradation and recycling of the expensive metals.
  This work lays the foundation for the use of hydrogels as promising substrates for
  the next generation of environmentally friendly electronics.
