abstract: Nanodroplets of Gallium‐Based Liquid Metal (LM) have applications in stretchable
  electronics, electrochemical sensors, energy storage, hyperthermia, and rapid polymerization.
  The gallium oxide layer around LMNDs prevents aggregation. However, LM nanodroplets
  (LMNDs) are neither mechanically nor chemically stable. The ultrathin oxide layer
  ruptures under slight pressure, hindering their use in stretchable electronics.
  The shell also dissolves in slightly acidic/alkaline solutions, making them unstable
  for energy storage and electrochemical sensing. We demonstrate the synthesis of
  a dry LM powder with an LM core and a reduced graphene oxide shell. Graphene oxide
  provides excellent mechanical and chemical stability and permits electrical conductivity.
  Its porous structure does not block ion exchange between the LM droplets and the
  environment, allowing LMNDs to be used in energy storage and electrochemical sensing.
  The resulting EGaIn powders benefit from higher surface and long‐term stability,
  addressing LMND limitations. We report using GO@EGaIn nanocomposite as an anode
  for alkali‐ion batteries in a novel Ag‐EGaIn cell with impressive energy storage
  capacity. The combination of liquid deformability of LMNDs, higher surface area
  in the nano form, and the stability of GO@EGaIn dry powder expands the applications
  of liquid metals in electronics and energy storage.
