abstract: This study presents a system for detecting the location of a robotic hand
  on a planar surface. The system uses a radiofrequency (RF) probe attached to the
  robotic hand and printed resonators on the object surface to detect the hand's orientation.
  The system employs an ad-hoc designed coplanar antenna with a ground plane for the
  probe and bent dipole resonators of various sizes on the surface. The sensing is
  performed within a close range along one direction. The system is numerically designed
  and then fabricated using a 3D printer and patented conductive ink. Measurements
  are carried out to assess the simulated results. The proposed probe-resonator configuration
  allows for the identification of the hand's location relative to the resonators
  on the work surface with a promising level of accuracy.
