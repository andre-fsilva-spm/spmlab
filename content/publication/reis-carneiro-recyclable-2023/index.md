abstract: Abstract  Despite advances in soft, sticker‐like electronics, few efforts
  have dealt with the challenge of electronic waste. Here, this is addressed by introducing
  an eco‐friendly conductive ink for thin‐film circuitry composed of silver flakes
  and a water‐based polyurethane dispersion. This ink uniquely combines high electrical
  conductivity (1.6 × 10 5 S m −1 ), high resolution digital printability, robust
  adhesion for microchip integration, mechanical resilience, and recyclability.  Recycling
  is achieved with an ecologically‐friendly processing method to decompose the circuits
  into constituent elements and recover the conductive ink with a decrease of only
  2.4% in conductivity. Moreover, adding liquid metal enables stretchability of up
  to 200% strain, although this introduces the need for more complex recycling steps.
  Finally, on‐skin electrophysiological monitoring biostickers along with a recyclable
  smart package with integrated sensors for monitoring safe storage of perishable
  foods are demonstrated.
