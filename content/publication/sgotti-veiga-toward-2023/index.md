abstract: Abstract Development of soft and compliant actuators has attracted tremendous
  attention due to their use in soft robotics, wearables, haptics, and assistive devices.
  Despite decades of progress, the goal of entirely digitally‐printed actuators has
  yet to be fully demonstrated. Digital printing permits rapid customization of the
  actuator's geometry, size, and deformation profile, and is a step toward mass customization
  of user‐specific wearables and soft robotic systems. Herein, a set of materials
  and methods are demonstrated for rapid fabrication of 3D‐printed Liquid Crystal
  Elastomer actuators electrically stimulated via a printed joule heater composed
  of a Liquid Metal (LM)‐filled elastomer composite. Unlike other Ag‐based inks, this
  LM‐elastomer composite is sinter‐free, enabling room‐temperature printing, and is
  stretchable, allowing cyclic actuation without electrical or mechanical failure
  of the conductor. By optimizing printing parameters, and improving the photo‐polymerization
  setup, a printed actuator that bends to an angle of 320° is demonstrated, with lower
  power consumption than previous LCE actuators. We also demonstrate a customized
  UV‐polymerization setup that permits photo‐curing of the LCE actuator in ≈90s, i.e.,
  textgreater500x faster compared to previous works. The rapid photo‐polymerization
  enables progress toward 3D‐printing of multi‐layer actuators and is a step toward
  mass customization of fully digitally‐printed robotic and wearable devices.
