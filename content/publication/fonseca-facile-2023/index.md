abstract: Abstract  Recently, highly stretchable and tough hydrogels that are photodegradable
  on‐demand have been reported. Unfortunately, the preparation procedure is complex
  due to the hydrophobic nature of the photocrosslinkers. Herein, a simple method
  is reported to prepare photodegradable double‐network (DN) hydrogels that exhibit
  high stretchability, toughness, and biocompatibility. Hydrophilic ortho ‐nitrobenzyl
  (ONB) crosslinkers incorporating different poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) backbones
  (600, 1000, and 2000 g mol −1 ) are synthesized. These photodegradable DN hydrogels
  are prepared by the irreversible crosslinking of chains by using such ONB crosslinkers,
  and the reversible ionic crosslinking between sodium alginate and divalent cations
  (Ca 2+ ). Remarkable mechanical properties are obtained by combining ionic and covalent
  crosslinking and their synergistic effect, and by reducing the length of the PEG
  backbone. The rapid on‐demand degradation of these hydrogels is also demonstrated
  by using cytocompatible light wavelength ( λ = 365 nm) that degrades the photosensitive
  ONB units. The authors have successfully used these hydrogels as skin‐worn sensors
  for monitoring human respiration and physical activities. A combination of excellent
  mechanical properties, facile fabrication, and on‐demand degradation holds promise
  for their application as the next generation of substrates or active sensors eco‐friendly
  for bioelectronics, biosensors, wearable computing, and stretchable electronics.
