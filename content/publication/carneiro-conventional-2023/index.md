abstract: This article presents a low-cost, and scalable method for synthesizing large
  sheets of functionalized foam for soft resistive pressure sensing that is compatible
  with any commercially available non-conductive foam. The process is illustrated
  by soaking Pu (Polyurethane) foam in a carbon-based polymeric mixture resulting
  in a functional foam with large pressure detection range up to 500 kPa, while retaining
  its deformability and recoverability after cyclic compression. The foam also shows
  unprecedentedly fast response time of 120 ms. The foam was integrated in a wearable
  respiration sensor and in a large multitouch sensing mat that allows for precise
  data acquisition on the position and intensity of various simultaneous touches without
  the occurrence of ghost touches.
