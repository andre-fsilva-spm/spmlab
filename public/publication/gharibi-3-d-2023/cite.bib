 abstract = {This study presents a system for detecting the location of a robotic hand on a planar surface. The system uses a radiofrequency (RF) probe attached to the robotic hand and printed resonators on the object surface to detect the hand's orientation. The system employs an ad-hoc designed coplanar antenna with a ground plane for the probe and bent dipole resonators of various sizes on the surface. The sensing is performed within a close range along one direction. The system is numerically designed and then fabricated using a 3D printer and patented conductive ink. Measurements are carried out to assess the simulated results. The proposed probe-resonator configuration allows for the identification of the hand's location relative to the resonators on the work surface with a promising level of accuracy.},
