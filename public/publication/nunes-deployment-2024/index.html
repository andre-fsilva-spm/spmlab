    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p class="pub-abstract">Conventional patient monitoring in healthcare has limitations such as delayed identification of deteriorating conditions, disruptions to patient routines, and discomfort due to extensive wiring for bed-bound patients. To address these, we have recently developed an innovative IoT-based healthcare system for real-time wireless patient monitoring. This system includes a flexible epidermal patch that collects vital signs using low power electronics and transmits the data to IoT nodes in hospital beds. The nodes connect to a smart gateway that aggregates the information and interfaces with the hospital information system (HIS), facilitating the exchange of electronic health records (EHR) and enhancing access to patient vital signs for healthcare professionals. Our study validates the proposed smart bed architecture in a clinical setting, assessing its ability to meet healthcare personnel needs, patient comfort, and data transmission reliability. Technical performance assessment involves analyzing key performance indicators for communication across various interfaces, including the wearable device and the smart box, and the link between the gateway and the HIS. Also, a comparative analysis is conducted on data from our architecture and traditional hospital equipment. Usability evaluation involves questionnaires completed by patients and healthcare professionals. Results demonstrate the robustness of the architecture proposed, exhibiting reliable and efficient information flow, while offering significant improvements in patient monitoring over conventional wired methods, including unrestricted mobility and improved comfort to enhance healthcare delivery.</p>
