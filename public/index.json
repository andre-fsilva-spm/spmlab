Recently, we developed a fully 3D‐printed soft‐matter thin‐film Ga‐Ag 2 O battery with 3R characteristics: resilient to mechanical strain, repairable after damage, and recyclable. This battery achieved a record‐breaking areal capacity of 26.37 mAh cm −2 , increasing to 30.32 mAh cm −2 after 10 cycles under 100% strain. This performance stems from the synergistic effects of gallium's liquid metal properties and the styrene‐isoprene‐styrene polymer in the anode. Gallium's high specific capacity (1153.2 mAh g −1 ), deformability, and self‐healing abilities, supported by its supercooled liquid phase, significantly enhance the battery's resilience and efficiency. However, the cathode's lower theoretical capacity, due to Ag 2 O (231.31 mAh g −1 ), remains a limitation. Traditional Ag 2 O‐carbon black‐styrene‐isoprene‐styrene cathodes experience rapid capacity decay as only the surface area of the active materials interacts with the electrolyte. To overcome this, we designed a carbon‐filled Ag 2 O foam electrode using a sacrificial sugar template, increasing the effective surface area. This optimization enhanced ion‐exchange efficiency, specific capacity, and cyclability, achieving a specific capacity of 221.16 mAh g −1 . Consequently, the Ga‐Ag 2 O stretchable battery attained a record areal capacity of 40.91 mAh cm −2 —double that of nonfoam electrodes—and exhibited fivefold improved charge–discharge cycles. Using ultrastretchable Ag‐EGaIn‐styrene‐isoprene‐styrene and carbon black‐styrene‐isoprene‐styrene current collectors, the battery's specific capacity increased by 33% under 50% strain. Integrated into a soft‐matter smart wristband for temperature monitoring, the battery demonstrated its promise for wearable electronics.","tags":["liquid3d"],"title":"High‐Performance Stretchable Gallium Battery for Wearable Electronics, Through Synthesis of Foam Electrodes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Afsaneh L.

The gallium oxide layer around LMNDs prevents aggregation. However, LM nanodroplets (LMNDs) are neither mechanically nor chemically stable. The ultrathin oxide layer ruptures under slight pressure, hindering their use in stretchable electronics. The shell also dissolves in slightly acidic/alkaline solutions, making them unstable for energy storage and electrochemical sensing. We demonstrate the synthesis of a dry LM powder with an LM core and a reduced graphene oxide shell. Graphene oxide provides excellent mechanical and chemical stability and permits electrical conductivity. Its porous structure does not block ion exchange between the LM droplets and the environment, allowing LMNDs to be used in energy storage and electrochemical sensing. The resulting EGaIn powders benefit from higher surface and long‐term stability, addressing LMND limitations. We report using GO@EGaIn nanocomposite as an anode for alkali‐ion batteries in a novel Ag‐EGaIn cell with impressive energy storage capacity. The combination of liquid deformability of LMNDs, higher surface area in the nano form, and the stability of GO@EGaIn dry powder expands the applications of liquid metals in electronics and energy storage.","tags":["liquid3d"],"title":"Biphasic Graphene‐Oxide Liquid Metal Powder: Synthesis, Characterization, and Application in Energy Storage","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Denis Rocha","Pedro Lopes","Paulo Peixoto","Aníbal De Almeida","Mahmoud Tavakoli"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1740787200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1740787200,"objectID":"443ac05d0200d0b0d1d31e0eac421900","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/rocha-miniaturized-2025/","publishdate":"2025-07-29T19:43:31.154407Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rocha-miniaturized-2025/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract  Over the past years, rapid progress has been made on soft‐matter electronics for wearable and implantable devices, for bioelectronics and optogenetics. Liquid Metal (LM) based electronics are especially popular, due to their long‐term durability, when subject to repetitive strain cycles. However, one major limitation has been the need for tethering bioelectronics circuits to external power, or the use of rigid bulky batteries. This has motivated a growing interest in wireless energy transfer, which demands circuit miniaturization. However, miniaturization of LM circuits is challenging due to low LM‐substrate adhesion, LM smearing, and challenges on microchip‐interfacing. In this article, these challenges are addressed by high‐resolution laser‐assisted micropatterning of biphasic LM composites and vapor‐assisted LM microchip soldering. Through the development of a search algorithm for optimization of the biphasic ink coil performance, micro coils with trace spacing of 50 µm are designed and implemented that can harvest a significant amount of energy (178 mW cm −2 ) through near field inductive coupling. Miniaturized soft‐matter circuits with integrated SMD chips such as NFC chips, capacitors, and LEDs that are implemented in a few minutes through laser patterning, and vapor‐assisted soldering. In the context of optogenetics, where lightweight, miniaturized systems are needed to provide optical stimulation, soft coils stand out in terms of their improved conformability and flexibility. Thus, this article explores the applications of soft coils in wearable and implantable devices, with a specific focus on their use in optogenetics.","tags":["liquid3d"],"title":"Miniaturized Liquid Metal Composite Circuits with Energy Harvesting Coils for Battery‐Free Bioelectronics and Optogenetics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tânia Nunes","Luís Gaspar","José N.

To address these, we have recently developed an innovative IoT-based healthcare system for real-time wireless patient monitoring. This system includes a flexible epidermal patch that collects vital signs using low power electronics and transmits the data to IoT nodes in hospital beds. The nodes connect to a smart gateway that aggregates the information and interfaces with the hospital information system (HIS), facilitating the exchange of electronic health records (EHR) and enhancing access to patient vital signs for healthcare professionals. Our study validates the proposed smart bed architecture in a clinical setting, assessing its ability to meet healthcare personnel needs, patient comfort, and data transmission reliability. Technical performance assessment involves analyzing key performance indicators for communication across various interfaces, including the wearable device and the smart box, and the link between the gateway and the HIS. Also, a comparative analysis is conducted on data from our architecture and traditional hospital equipment. Usability evaluation involves questionnaires completed by patients and healthcare professionals. Results demonstrate the robustness of the architecture proposed, exhibiting reliable and efficient information flow, while offering significant improvements in patient monitoring over conventional wired methods, including unrestricted mobility and improved comfort to enhance healthcare delivery.","tags":["ADAS","Connectivity","E/E","e-Health","Internet of Things","Medical and Health Technologies","Smart Infrastructure","Wearable Technology","Digital healthcare","Internet of Things","Interoperability","Performance metrics"],"title":"Deployment and validation of a smart bed architecture for untethered patients with wireless biomonitoring stickers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Abdollah Hajalilou","Elahe Parvini","Tiago A.

The prize was awarded to researchers from the UC Institute of Systems and Robotics.\nThe winner of the 3rd edition of the J. Norberto Pires Innovation Prize, awarded by the University of Coimbra (UC), is the ‘E-Skins’ project, which focuses on developing electronic patches for biomonitoring health data, such as heartbeat and brain activity. The award was presented on Wednesday, the 25th of September, to researchers Mahmoud Tavakoli, Manuel Reis Carneiro, and Pedro Lopes, from the UC Institute of Systems and Robotics.\nThe winning project offers a more practical and durable solution for patients who need wearable devices for continuous, long-term electrophysiological health monitoring: a type of ’electronic skin’ that uses innovative materials and methods and can be worn comfortably for over a week.\n“With E-Skins, we propose an innovative architecture of materials and methods for implementing multi-electrode thin-film bioelectronic patches for continuous electrophysiological monitoring over long periods of time. Unlike other existing wearable patches, this solution can be worn for more than a week and is unaffected by daily routines such as exercise or showering. For the electrodes, we use a patented conductive ink that combines the advantages of dry electrodes (printability and material integrity) with the advantages of wet electrodes (high signal quality),” the researchers explain.\nThese electronic patches have ‘mechanical properties similar to human skin, improving patient comfort and reducing noise.’ They also offer other advantages, such as low-cost production and 24/7 remote patient monitoring. ‘Manufacturing based on digital printing techniques allows for implementing low-cost, customised e-adhesives for each patient or application. Additionally, the patch integrates a universal miniaturised electronic system for biopotential sensing via bioadhesive and wireless communication, already demonstrated in a hospital environment. This innovative approach enables 24/7 patient monitoring at home, allowing them to maintain their routines, which speeds up recovery and reduces costs for the healthcare system,’ explain Mahmoud Tavakoli, Manuel Reis Carneiro, and Pedro Lopes.\nThe jury also awarded two honourable mentions in this edition. One was given to ‘AR73/74 - Antes da Revolução | 1973-1974’ (AR73/74 - Before the Revolution | 1973-1974), a multimedia project by Clara Almeida Santos and Francisco Sena Santos, based on a series of portraits that depict life in Portugal during the months immediately preceding the revolution of 25 April 1974.

For these cases, traditional rigid batteries are not optimal neither in terms of form and ergonomics nor ecological aspects. There is an urgent need for a new class of energy storage devices that are thin, stretchable, resilient, and recyclable. Herein, a novel architecture of materials and fabrication techniques is presented that permit a fully 3D printed soft‐matter thin‐film battery that is Resilient to mechanical strain, Repairable if cut, Rechargeable, and Recyclable at the end of its life. By taking advantage of a digitally printable ultra‐stretchable liquid metal‐based current collector and a novel Gallium‐Carbon anode electrode, the Ag 2 O‐Gallium battery is rapidly printed and customized per application. By optimizing the properties of the Gallium‐Carbon composite, a record‐breaking areal capacity of 26.37 mAh cm −2 is obtained, which improves after 10 cycles at 100% strain to 30.32 mAh cm −2 , and an unprecedented maximum strain tolerance of ≈200%.

Gallium alloys like Eutectic Gallium Indium (EGaIn) are appealing due to their low melting point and high theoretical specific capacity. However, EGaIn electrodes are unstable in highly alkaline electrolytes due to Gallium oxide dissolution. In this letter, this bottleneck is addressed by introducing chemically stable films in which nanoscale droplets of EGaIn are coated with trace amounts of graphene oxide (GO). It is demonstrated that a GO to EGaIn weight ratio as low as 0.01 provides enough protection for a thin film formed by GO@EGaIn nanocomposite against significantly acidic or alkaline environments (pH 1‐14). It is shown that GO coating significantly enhances the surface stability in such environments, thus improving the energy storage capacity by over 10x. Microstructural analysis confirms GO@EGaIn composite stability and enhanced electrochemical performance. Utilizing this, a thin‐film supercapacitor is fabricated. Results indicate that when coating the EGaIn with GO to EGaIn ratio of 0.001, the areal capacitance improves by 10 times, reaching 20.02 mF cm −2 . This breakthrough paves the way for advanced liquid metal‐based thin‐film electrodes, promising significant improvements in energy storage applications.","tags":["liquid3d"],"title":"Graphene‐Assisted Chemical Stabilization of Liquid Metal Nano Droplets for Liquid Metal Based Energy Storage","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Elahe Parvini","Abdollah Hajalilou","João Pedro Gonçalves Vilarinho","Pedro Alhais Lopes","Miguel Maranha","Mahmoud Tavakoli"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1717200000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1717200000,"objectID":"17b158cc64204495b7eb4deb5ccc5889","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/parvini-galliumcarbon-2024/","publishdate":"2025-07-29T19:43:31.202029Z","relpermalink":"/publication/parvini-galliumcarbon-2024/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["liquid3d"],"title":"Gallium–Carbon: A Universal Composite for Sustainable 3D Printing of Integrated Sensor–Heater–Battery Systems in Wearable and Recyclable Electronics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marta Calisto Freitas","Afsaneh L.

However, EGaIn droplets could never be used as electrodes in thin-film supercapacitors (SCs) at the desired micro/nano scale, because they rapidly coalesce into bulk EGaIn when contacting acidic/alkaline electrolytes. Here, we show that coating EGaIn droplets with only 0.08 wt% of reduced graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets tremendously improves their chemical stability. We fabricated binder-free GO-coated EGaIn nanocomposite electrodes that show excellent stability in a strong alkaline electrolyte. We demonstrated a symmetric soft-matter pseudo-SC with areal capacitances of 1200mF/cm2@0.3 mA/cm2 and 220mF/cm2@1mA/cm2, which is textgreater 10 × compared to previous SCs based on bulk EGaIn. This SC retains 98.4 % of the initial capacitance after 4000 electrochemical cycles and exhibits comparable self-discharge rates to state-of-the-art flexible pseudo-SCs. Surprisingly, applying mechanical strain results in improved areal capacitance. We demonstrate rapid, laser-based fabrication of a wirelessly chargeable elastic film with an integrated energy harvesting antenna and energy-storage SC that can be used in wearable biomonitoring patches, and e-textiles. Finally, we demonstrate the recovery of the metals from the disposed of SCs through an electrowinning technique.","tags":["Eutectic gallium indium liquid metal","Reduced graphene oxide","Recyclable supercapacitor","Stretchable energy storage","Wearable electronics","liquid3d"],"title":"Recyclable liquid metal – Graphene supercapacitor","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Emanuel Ferreira-Fernandes","Mariana Laranjo","Tiago Reis","Bárbara Canijo","Pedro A.

In recent years, multiple material architectures have been proposed for highly deformable circuits that can undergo large tensile strains without losing electronic functionality. Among them, gallium‐based liquid metals benefit from fluidic deformability, high electrical conductivity, and self‐healing property. However, their deposition and patterning is challenging. Biphasic material architectures are recently proposed as a method to address this problem, by combining advantages of solid‐phase materials and composites, with liquid deformability and self‐healing of liquid phase conductors, thus moving toward scalable fabrication of reliable stretchable circuits. This article reviews recent biphasic conductor architectures that combine gallium‐based liquid‐phase conductors, with solid‐phase particles and polymers, and their application in fabrication of soft electronic systems. In particular, various material combinations for the solid and liquid phases in the biphasic conductor, as well as methods used to print and pattern biphasic conductive compounds, are discussed.

Hydrogels, a class of soft polymers with exceptional properties, and high water content are rarely used as substrates, mainly due to lack of ink‐adhesion and rapid dehydration. Herein, photodegradable hydrogels are tailor‐made that are nondrying, robust, adhesive to ink, and permit triggerable degradation, making them suitable substrates for sustainable electronics.

Herein, a simple method is reported to prepare photodegradable double‐network (DN) hydrogels that exhibit high stretchability, toughness, and biocompatibility. Hydrophilic ortho ‐nitrobenzyl (ONB) crosslinkers incorporating different poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) backbones (600, 1000, and 2000 g mol −1 ) are synthesized. These photodegradable DN hydrogels are prepared by the irreversible crosslinking of chains by using such ONB crosslinkers, and the reversible ionic crosslinking between sodium alginate and divalent cations (Ca 2+ ). Remarkable mechanical properties are obtained by combining ionic and covalent crosslinking and their synergistic effect, and by reducing the length of the PEG backbone. The rapid on‐demand degradation of these hydrogels is also demonstrated by using cytocompatible light wavelength ( λ = 365 nm) that degrades the photosensitive ONB units.

It is shown that using 3 parallel PIFA antennas, it is possible to harvest ≈10 mW at 30 cm from the transmitter, which is ≈7× the required power by the ECG circuit. This study proves the feasibility of next generation of battery‐free wearable biomonitoring patches/e‐textiles and demonstrates materials and methods for fabrication of optimized printed antennas.","tags":null,"title":"Digitally Printed Liquid Metal Composite Antenna for Energy Harvesting: Toward Energy‐Autonomous Battery‐Free Wearable Bioelectronics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Epsita Kar","Puja Ghosh","Shewli Pratihar","Mahmoud Tavakoli","Shrabanee Sen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1675209600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675209600,"objectID":"b931847f49baab7158d1d94aff6ac670","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/kar-sio-2-2023/","publishdate":"2025-07-29T19:43:31.343059Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kar-sio-2-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"Flexible electronic skins (e‐skins) have a wide range of applications in health monitoring, human–machine interfaces, and robotics. Herein, a novel architecture of e‐skins with a combination of multimode measurement and low‐cost implementation is proposed. A single electronic skin layer is used to integrate both the pressure and temperature sensing properties. An e‐skin membrane is first developed with poly(vinylidene) fluoride incorporated with silicon dioxide nanoparticles. When combined with electrodes, this simple architecture allows the implementation of multimode pressure and temperature sensing. This e‐skin exhibits excellent pressure sensitivity with a response time of 1.6 ms. This sensing performance can be attributed to the uniform distribution of the embedded nanoparticles, leading to an enhancement of the electroactive β phase. This e‐skin generates a voltage, from the finger movements, that can be used to detect precisely the minute changes of the finger movement. This electronic skin demonstrates the detection of a linear range of temperature which can be attributed to the phonon‐assisted hopping mechanism. A 4 × 4 pressure sensing array is demonstrated, which is able to map the inserted pressure as well as temperature stimuli. Thus, this study provides a new conceptual design for the next‐generation green electronic skins.","tags":null,"title":"SiO$_textrm2$ Nanoparticles Incorporated Poly(Vinylidene) Fluoride Composite for Efficient Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting and Dual‐Mode Sensing","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Mahmoud Tavakoli, director of the “Soft and Printed Microelectronics Laboratory” at the Institute of Systems and Robotics (ISR) of the Faculty of Science and Technology of Universidade de Coimbra (FCTUC), has just won a prestigious European Research Council Consolidator grant (ERC) for five years.\nThe researcher will receive 2.8M€ to study futuristic electronic circuits, a topic he has been working on for several years under the scope of projects funded through Carnegie Mellon Portugal (CMU Portugal). The ERC Consolidator Grant will support the project “Liquid3D: 3D Printed, Bioinspired, Soft-Matter Electronics based on Liquid Metal Composites: Eco-Friendly, Resilient, Recyclable, and Repairable”, which is already underway and aims to provide design freedom to scientists, allowing them to print futuristic soft electronics and soft machines. «The idea is to make a transition from rigid, breakable, polluting and battery-dependent electronics to soft, resilient, recyclable, and self-powered electronics. In this context, the Liquid3D project will develop a series of innovative printable composites based on liquid metals to print 3D functional cells for sensing, stimulating, processing, and storing energy that is entangled in a distributed system and in a three-dimensional architecture», explains Mahmoud Tavakoli.\nAccording to the researcher, “the most impressive thing about these systems is that they will allow a new level of bioinspiration in man-made devices, which is not yet possible”. For doing that, this project will develop novel printable biphasic composites based on liquid metal, and methods to print them, and finally procedures that allow recycling them.\n“ERC projects fund high-risk, high-reward fundamental science. My goal is to redefine electronics and robotics», shares the researcher, concluding that he foresees a fundamental change in the materials used in electronics and robotics and how they will be made. “We’re talking about a wide range of soft, self-healing materials that can be printed together to permit a level of bioinspiration never seen before. This is due to a variety of new printable materials and printing technologies that will allow printing sensors, batteries, and electronic circuits to function side by side, like what we see in biology».\nThe Liquid3D project was launched this month of January and will permit the implementation of three new laboratories at FCTUC, namely the Laboratory of Soft and Printed Materials, which is intended to develop new materials for the next generation of electronics and robotics; the Digital Fabrication Laboratory, to create and validate technologies for additive manufacturing of the developed materials; and the Microscopy and Characterization Laboratory, to characterize electrical, mechanical and optical properties of the materials and systems produced.\nMahmoud Tavakoli manages a multi-disciplinary research team of Electrical, Chemical, Biomedical and Mechanical Engineers that combines expertise in nano materials, polymers, and liquid conductors for the applications of soft robotics, soft electronics, smart textile, smart plastics, and health monitoring. His research work at the “Soft and Printed Microelectronics Laboratory” from ISR Coimbra has been strongly supported by CMU Portugal Program and Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT). Through this partnership, the FCTUC team has collaborated with the Soft Machines Lab from Carnegie Mellon University’s College of Engineering on three projects: Stretchtonics, one of CMU Portugal Entrepreneurial Research Initiatives; WoW, one of our Large Scale Collaborative Projects which is led by Glintt; and the Exploratory research project Exoskins. The research developed under this partnership includes stretchable electronics, wearable computing, wearable patient monitoring, printed sensors and electronics, digital health, and digital biomarkers.\nRead the original text in CMU Portugal’s website ","date":1673395200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1673395200,"objectID":"7160b2d568f7cb2d18e89041016f753e","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/post/23-01-11-erc_funding/","publishdate":"2023-01-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/23-01-11-erc_funding/","section":"post","summary":"Mahmoud Tavakoli, director of the “Soft and Printed Microelectronics Laboratory” at the Institute of Systems and Robotics (ISR) of the Faculty of Science and Technology of Universidade de Coimbra (FCTUC), has just won a prestigious European Research Council Consolidator grant (ERC) for five years.\n","tags":null,"title":"CMU Portugal Researcher at Universidade de Coimbra wins a 2.8M€ ERC Grant Consolidator","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/contact/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Contact","type":"landing"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The Portuguese television network “SIC” had a news reel piece about our lab, regarding our techniques to produce stretchable electronics and reduce waste.\n","date":1662508800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1662508800,"objectID":"7adbafc9a311eb55894a5316405ecbf4","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/post/22-09-07-interview_sic/","publishdate":"2022-09-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/22-09-07-interview_sic/","section":"post","summary":"The Portuguese television network “SIC” had a news reel piece about our lab, regarding our techniques to produce stretchable electronics and reduce waste.\n","tags":null,"title":"SIC news reel about reducing electronic waste","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The Portuguese program of Exame Informatica regarding our lab’s development of E-Skins.
